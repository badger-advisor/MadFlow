To help you self-assess your preparedness for CS300, we encourage you to work through the following self-assessment assignment: http://cs300-www.cs.wisc.edu/wp/index.php/assignments/peg-solitaire/\n\nCS300 introduces students to Algorithm Analysis, Recursion, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and Abstract Data Types (ADTs). OOP involves organizing code into objects which are collections of data and methods. ADTs are sets of high level operations that can be implemented with a variety of different algorithms and data structures, as more concrete objects. In addition to developing multiple implementations of common ADTs, CS300 students will also learn to analyze, compare, and contrast the complexities of these implementations.",

Students are required to design and implement using high quality professional code, a medium sized program, that demonstrates knowledge and use of latest language features, tools, and conventions. Additional topics introduced will include as needed for projects: inheritance and polymorphism; anonymous inner classes, lambda functions, performance analysis to discover and optimize critical code blocks. Students learn about industry standards for code development. Students will design and implement a medium size project with a more advanced user-interface design, such as a web or mobile application with a GUI and event- driven implementation; use of version-control software.

Survey topics include historical perspectives on virtual reality technology, computer graphics and 3D modeling, human perception and psychology, human computer interaction and user interface design. This course is designed for students with backgrounds in Computer Science, Engineering, Art, Architecture and Design. Students will work in interdisciplinary teams on projects, culminating in a final event that will be showcased to the public. While not an official uisite, the class will be technologically motivated; therefore students should be comfortable learning new software. The class will utilize publicly available game design software which provides tools and services for the creation of interactive content. While not necessary, students may find it helpful to have taken classes in programming and computer graphics (such COMP SCI 559: Computer Graphics) or in 3D modeling (such as ART 429: 3D Digital Studio I or DS 242: Visual Communication II).

We might not have room for everybody interested, unfortunately.  The prereq is CS 301.  If you haven't taken that, but have experience with Python (including Jupyter, pandas, and matplotlib), I may override the prereq; in this case, please email me (tylerharter@gmail.com) a Jupyter notebook file demoing your skills.\nYou'll need a laptop that you'll use to present your work to the class on a regular basis (you might need to buy a video adapter for the room if you don't have an HDMI port).\n\nTime: 4-6pm on Thursdays.\n\nCourse Description:\n\nThis course will involve writing Python code to analyze and visualize data sets about the City of Madison, WI.  The\ngoal will be to arrive at actionable suggestions.  In 2012, the city adopted an open-data policy; projects will analyze data that is released under this policy (http://data-cityofmadison.opendata.arcgis.com/) and possibly other data that city collaborators may provide for this course.  Project teams will create data visualizations and present them to the class on a weekly basis.  Teams will choose their projects and set their own research agenda.  Possible topics include, but are not limited to, (1) exploring alterations to metro routes to improve efficiency, (2) identifying ways to reduce traffic accidents, (3) projecting property tax revenue, (4) simulating changes in salary spending across city departments, and (5) identifying ways to reduce incident response times for the fire and police departments.\n\nStudents will form teams of 2-4 people and choose a topic.  Within each team, each of you will be expected to produce 2-3 high-quality visualizations per week about your chosen topic; the code and plots will be committed to a team git repo. You will state the question(s) that motivate each plot and explicitly write their conclusions; you will further organize the plots into a logical narrative sequence.  Each week, you should be prepared to present your weekly analysis to the class; depending on enrollment, you might present every week, or I may randomly select a subset of the class to present each week.  At the end of the semester, each team will consolidate their results into a full presentation.  You will be graded on (1) your visualizations, (2) your communication about those visualizations, (3) your participation in discussing the results of other students, and (4) your final presentation.\n\nIf interested, complete this form:            https://forms.gle/Jnt2GMNaDF4UAU3z9         by August 23.",

While the\ncourse will focus primarily on transportation in the City of Madison,\nthe scope is not limited to transportation, and teams may choose\nprojects related to other Wisconsin cities, or to the state more\nbroadly.  Analysis will be done in Python; students will learn how to\napply machine learning (with scikit-learn) to civic data and how to\nwork with and visualize geographic datasets.\n\nIdentifying good analysis questions and understanding the space of\npossible policies is a key part of this course; gaining this\ndomain-specific knowledge will involve some background reading and\nattending or watching meetings of relevant decision makers (for\nexample, on https://madison.legistar.com/Calendar.aspx).  The course\nwill also provide ample opportunity to practice communicating about\nanalysis results, both verbally and in written form.  The focus will\nbe on making concrete suggestions, actionable by the target audience.\n\nWhat students will do: Students will form teams of 2-4 people, with\neach team choosing a topic and target audience (ideally consisting of\nactual people with whom the team will connect early in the semester).\nIndividually, each student will be expected to produce 2-3\nhigh-quality visualizations per week about the given topic.  Teams\nwill be expected to (a) present their results to the class on a\nregular basis, and (b) add them, along with supporting text, to a\nwritten report that will be developed throughout the semester.  The\nsemester will conclude with final presentations.  Students will be\ngraded on (1) their ability to identify interesting analysis\nquestions, (2) their visualizations, (3) their verbal and written\ncommunication about those visualizations, (4) their participation in\ndiscussing the results of other students, and (5) their final reports\nand presentations.\n\nLearning outcomes:\n - create advanced visualizations, including maps and animations\n - formulate research questions and answer them by writing code\n - contextualize analysis results in terms of policy and current events\n - provide constructive feedback to peers\n - argue using data\n\n\nPrerequisites: CS 220/301 or instructor approval. Students who have taken CS 320 will have higher priority.\nEnrollment in COMP SCI 638 002 will be limited to 20 participants, selected by the instructor. To be considered, students should place themselves on the waiting list for the course and fill this form prior to June 1st: https://forms.gle/V8CghneYnK6B1b539. Students will be notified by June 15th about whether they can enroll.",

Some background in discrete mathematics (probability theory, modular arithmetic) and algorithms will be helpful, but all necessary prerequisites will be reviewed in class. Special emphasis will be on applications that illustrate the utility of various cryptographic primitives, such as the use of digital certificates in on-line shopping and use of Merkle hash trees in blockchains.\n\nStudents who have completed, or who are concurrently enrolled in CS/ECE/Math 435 are not eligible to enroll in this course.\n\nPREREQS: Math 320, 340, 341, or 375",

In response to this challenge, researchers have\n   devised radically new approaches, in which computation is\n   based on chemistry, optics, or quantum mechanics.  Alongside\n   of this has been an effort to re-examine our concept of\n   information.\n\n   This course will survey these ``new fundamentals'' for\n   computer science.  Of course, we will need to learn some\n   ``old fundamentals'' as well.   Thus, the course can serve\n   as an introduction to theoretical computer science for\n   engineers and physical scientists, and an introduction to\n   physical theories of computation for computer scientists\n   and mathematicians.\n\nPrerequisites:\n\n   Similar to CS 520 or permission of instructor. You should be familiar with data\n   structures and big-O style algorithm analysis (covered in\n   CS 400/367) and have some facility with combinatorial\n   mathematics topics like finite sets, discrete probability,\n   and number theory (covered in CS/Math 240).  For the\n   second part of the course, some exposure to modern physics\n   (e.g. Physics 241, 244 or 249) would be beneficial.\n\nReadings:\n\n  Richard Feynman's Lectures on Computation (edited by Anthony Hey).",

The course is targeted both towards students interested in using visualization in their own work, as well as students interested in building better visualization tools and systems. The class will meet twice a week. In addition to participating in lectures, discussions, and activities, students will have to complete several programming and data analysis assignments.\n\nPre-Reqs: CS400 or CS320\nRecommended: some Statistics background, some web programming experience (CS559 or Prof. Mutlu's CS639)",

Students will learn how to model and reason about data, and how to process and manipulate it in various ways. Topics will include data cleaning, data integration, scalable systems (relational databases, NoSQL, Hadoop, etc.), analytics (data cubes, scalable statistics and machine learning), and scalable visualization of large data sets. The course will be heavily assignment-based with bi-weekly assignments, and will draw extensively from applications.\n\nRequirements:\n\nBasic Python programming. CS 367 or CS 400 is recommended.",

Importantly, the world gives feedback to the algorithm after each decision, and may change the environment surrounding the algorithm.  The algorithm must improve itself from the feedback and make good decisions as time goes on.  This is in contrast to supervised learning where typically training is done once beforehand.   The focus of the course will be reinforcement learning, though we will also discuss active learning, multi-armed bandits, and stochastic games.  Mathematical maturity (probability and statistics, linear algebra, calculus) and programming skills (data structure, python) are necessary.  \n\nCourse webpage:   http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~jerryzhu/cs639s2021.html \n\n\nPrerequisites: CS540 OR CS532.",

Students from all majors are invited to apply, although computer science majors will be given priority if enrollment exceeds capacity.\n\nThis course introduces undergraduate students to research into computer systems designed for human use and human interaction with these systems. Students will carry out a semester-long research project in teams, which will provide context to learn and practice how to formulate a research question, how to design and carry out a study to investigate the research question, and how to build research systems to aid this investigation.\n\nFluency in multiple programming languages and experience in using APIs are strongly recommended but not required.\n\nCS 639 sections are advanced-level topics courses, comparable to a 400-600 -level COMP SCI course. Therefore, CS 639 sections, count towards the CS major as an advanced CS elective.",

Unfortunately, there are individuals -- including vandals and professional criminals -- who wish to compromise the security and privacy of these computer systems. Computer security is the discipline dedicated to protecting computer systems and their users from the malicious actions of adversaries. This research intensive course is designed to bring participants to the forefront of modern computer security research, thereby giving students the foundations for advancing the state-of-the-art in the field. This course also targets individuals in other fields who wish to address security and privacy in their own research. A part of this course will be a deep dive on security topics in cyber-physical systems, machine learning, and their combination.\n\nWe will begin by defining the field of computer security, introducing key concepts such as adversaries, threat models, risk management, defenses, and deterrents. We then study the central themes of modern computer security research, including: human aspects; attack creation and modeling; attack detection and measurement; cryptography and communications security; system design and implementation; web and smartphone security and privacy; machine learning security; cyber-physical systems, and side channels. Because of its strong research focus, participants in the course will read and discuss research papers, as well as conduct independent research in a topic related to computer security.",

Some background in discrete mathematics (probability\ntheory, modular arithmetic) and algorithms will be helpful, but all necessary prerequisites will be\nreviewed in class. Special emphasis will be on applications that illustrate the utility of various cryp-\ntographic primitives, such as the use of digital certificates in on-line shopping and use of Merkle\nhash trees in blockchains.",

Students will not only learn the fundamentals of cryptocurrencies, but also judge protocols and systems on their technical merit -- an essential skill to navigate this crowded space. While the class aims to cover a broad range of topics, emphasis will be given to those relating to distributed systems. This is particularly interesting as blockchains operate under different failure and trust assumptions as \"conventional  distributed systems. \nLectures will be mostly discussion-based and each student is expected to provide detailed notes for at least one lecture in written form. Instead of a final exam, students are expected to work on an independent project of their choice throughout the semester\n\nMore course information can be found here:  https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~kaimast/classes/cs839/",

In response to this challenge, researchers have\n   devised radically new approaches, in which computation is\n   based on chemistry, optics, or quantum mechanics.  Alongside\n   of this has been an effort to re-examine our concept of\n   information.\n\n   This course will survey these ``new fundamentals'' for\n   computer science.  Of course, we will need to learn some\n   ``old fundamentals'' as well.   Thus, the course can serve\n   as an introduction to theoretical computer science for\n   engineers and physical scientists, and an introduction to\n   physical theories of computation for computer scientists\n   and mathematicians.\n\nPrerequisites:\n\n   Similar to CS 520. You should be familiar with data\n   structures and big-O style algorithm analysis (covered in\n   CS 400/367) and have some facility with combinatorial\n   mathematics topics like finite sets, discrete probability,\n   and number theory (covered in CS/Math 240).  For the\n   second part of the course, some exposure to modern physics\n   (e.g. Physics 241, 244 or 249) would be beneficial.\n\nReadings:\n\nRichard Feynman's Lectures on Computation (edited by Anthony Hey).",

There is a hidden catch, however: all state-of-the-art ML systems rely on high-effort data management tasks like data exploration, data preparation and data cleaning. The goal of this seminar course is to study data management challenges that arise in the context of machine learning pipelines. The focus will be on cutting-edge problems in the context of ML pipelines, related to (1) data exploration and understanding, (2) data integration, cleaning, and validation, and (3) data preparation for ML models and serving of production ML applications. The seminar will be very interactive and collaborative. The topics covered and the depth of coverage will depend on the participants' input and interests. The goal of the course is to give you an indepth look at an important, emerging topic in data management research. This course will provide research opportunities in the areas of data management, human-computer interaction, and machine learning. Along the way, you will also pick up some practical experience in reading and presenting research papers, synthesizing research across desperate areas, using existing tools, and doing a course project that ideally will lead to a publishable paper.",

It has real-world applications in many areas including content-based search, healthcare, and autonomous vehicles, with visual recognition tasks like image classification and object detection being core to many of those applications. Over the past decade, deep learning has greatly advanced the state-of-the-art in visual recognition research. This graduate course will dive into the fundamentals of deep learning for visual recognition, and survey the state-of-the-art in a broad range of topics including object recognition, activity recognition, and scene understanding.  It will be a mix of instructor led lectures and student led presentations. Students will learn to implement their own deep networks for visual recognition, to understand and analyze state-of-the-art techniques, and to identify interesting open questions and future directions.  It should be of relevance to students interested in computer vision and machine learning.\n\nPrerequisites:\nIt is recommended that students have taken either an intro computer vision or machine learning course.  Students are also strongly recommended to have basic knowledge of probability and linear algebra, and Python programming experience.",
