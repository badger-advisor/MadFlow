# MadFlow

Currently, students at the University of Wisconsin-Madison can navigate through their major requirement paths using a few different methods such as DARS, the major requirements web page, or the provided sample course flow. However, none of these tools are interactive or intuitive to use. For this project, we are building a web application that provides a solution to this problem.
