# MadFlow

ðŸŒŠ Helping students with course selection and planning

## Problem

Currently, students at the University of Wisconsin-Madison can navigate through their major requirement paths using a few different methods such as DARS, the major requirements web page, or the provided sample course flow. However, none of these tools are interactive or intuitive to use. For this project, we are building a web application that provides a solution to this problem.

## Structure

We are using the Model View Controller architecture for this app.

### `client/`

This is where all of the front-end magic happens. All of the React code is in here.

### `models/`

Here we define what our data will look like.

### `routes/`

Custom API routes for our Express server.

### `controllers/`

The brains of the server.
